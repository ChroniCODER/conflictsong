je peu ressentir ton corps
When I'm lying in my bed
Too much confusion
Going 'round through my head

Makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?
Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
Just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

Makes me so angry
To know now that the flame will always burn
Never get over
Know now that I'll never learn

Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Go on home
Take me home, boys
Old love
Leave me alone
Old love
Go on home
